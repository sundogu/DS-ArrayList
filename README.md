# DS-ArrayList

My implementation of ArrayList data structure. [ArrayList](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_arraylist.asp) is a List data structure that utilizes an Array as its main method of storing data. Unlike Arrays, ArrayList is dynamicaly resizable after creation.

# Time Complexity

My implementation of ArrayList has:
* Acess: O(1)
* Insert: O(n)
* Remove: O(n)

# Space Complexity

* O(n)
